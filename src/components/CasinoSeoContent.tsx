        allow you to withdraw funds, but you can still have a good time with
        entertainment. Options like Caliente Casino MX, Casino Twin Lions
        Guadalajara, and Jubilee Monterrey are physical casino options that
        provide support for Mexican players.

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Types of casino games</h2>
